I have chosen to analyse the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, a recently-passed(17th april 2019) European Parliament Directive. It is still extremely polarising and has been widely covered on traditional and social media.
I have found a dataset (.xslx) on all 751 MEPs from the 28 EU member states and their votes through the different stages of this directive.
