14/12/2019 - Retrieving birth dates and genders from summaries of MEPs wikipedia pages - using [wikipedia API](https://github.com/martin-majlis/Wikipedia-API)
		   - A significant proportion of these pages' summaries did not contain the date of birth of the MEP
15/12/2019 - Wikidata holds a page for every past or present MEP with basic information (gender,dob, ...)
	   - I accessed this by using the [WikiData API](https://github.com/dahlia/wikidata)
	   - Each page has a unique ID (eg. Q4992676). The next task was to collect the IDs for all MEP's pages.
	   - This was achieved by using a formula in Google Sheets found [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37024807/how-to-get-wikidata-id-for-an-wikipedia-article-by-api#answer-43030942
