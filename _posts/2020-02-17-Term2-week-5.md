One issue with scraping connections (follows & followers) for Twitter accounts is that I can only retrieve data from the present, not the past. This means that I could be taking into account connections that are more recent than the directive I am studying. I think that I could retrieve this data at the correct date using the official API.

14/02/2020 - I spoke to Jamie Forth asking whether Goldsmiths has institutional access to the official Twitter API and came back with a negative answer. I asked about the legality of scraping from Twitter instead, considering that the problem would be reduced if I didn't publish "hydrated" Twitter data.

I am curious whether the Twitter ToS apply to a scraper that does not require a login to function. I was not able to find any information on this.
