I want to add weights to the connections I have already collected. For this, I need to use communications between MEP accounts and their connections. I need keywords to search the Tweets by. To tackle the problem of the many different european languages, I have written a script that can find the hashtags used the most by MEPs in conjunction with given hashtags in a certain timeframe. 

The hashtags I have chosen to start with are: "#copyright", "#article13", "#article11".

The range of dates I am searching within is: from the proposal of the final version of the directive to parliament to a few days after the approval of the directive (13/02/2019 to 01/04/2019).

This procedure resulted in a list of hashtags/keywords that I will use in the next step.
